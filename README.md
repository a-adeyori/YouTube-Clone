# YouTube Clone (Frontend Only)

## Description

This project is a frontend-only clone of the popular video-sharing platform YouTube. The design replicates the layout and interface of YouTube, focusing on the visual aspects without any JavaScript functionality. The project demonstrates my ability to create complex, responsive layouts using modern CSS techniques.

- **Grid Layout**: Utilized CSS Grid for the overall page structure and layout.
- **Nested Grids**: Implemented nested grids for finer control over specific sections.
- **Flexbox**: Used Flexbox for flexible alignment and distribution of elements.
- **Nested Flexbox**: Applied nested Flexbox for more intricate designs within components.
- **Tooltips**: Added tooltips to provide additional information on hover.
- **Positioning**: Managed element positioning with CSS `position` and `z-index` for layered content.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
